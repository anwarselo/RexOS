# RexOS Development Challenges

This document tracks challenges encountered during the RexOS development process, including resolved issues, abandoned approaches, ongoing problems, and anticipated difficulties. It serves as both a knowledge base and a learning resource for the project.

## Resolved Challenges

### Database Structure Design
- **Challenge**: Determining the optimal structure for Michael's (Financial Guardian) tables
- **Date Encountered**: 2025-04-19
- **Resolution**: Reviewed sample data files in docs/modules/finance/sample-data and identified additional tables needed (Assets, Liabilities, Goals, Insurance Policies, Recurring Transactions)
- **Solution Date**: 2025-04-19
- **Lessons Learned**: Always check for sample data and existing documentation before designing database structures

### Document Management Requirements
- **Challenge**: Identifying comprehensive requirements for Alex's document management functionality
- **Date Encountered**: 2025-04-19
- **Resolution**: Created a more detailed document tracking system with expiry dates, reminders, categories, and history tracking
- **Solution Date**: 2025-04-19
- **Lessons Learned**: Consider lifecycle management for important data entities, especially those with temporal aspects like expiration dates

### Workout Tracking Complexity
- **Challenge**: Designing a flexible system for Mark's workout tracking that could handle various exercise types
- **Date Encountered**: 2025-04-19
- **Resolution**: Split tracking into separate tables for strength exercises and cardio, with the ability to track up to 5 sets per strength exercise
- **Solution Date**: 2025-04-19
- **Lessons Learned**: Domain-specific data often requires specialized structures; one-size-fits-all approaches may not be sufficient

## Ongoing Challenges

### WhatsApp API Limitations
- **Challenge**: Understanding and working within WhatsApp Business API limitations
- **Date Encountered**: 2025-04-19
- **Current Status**: Researching API documentation and limitations
- **Attempted Solutions**: N/A
- **Next Steps**: Test basic message sending and receiving capabilities
- **Impact**: May affect the responsiveness and functionality of the WhatsApp interface

### n8n Workflow Complexity
- **Challenge**: Managing complex workflows in n8n without creating maintenance issues
- **Date Encountered**: 2025-04-19
- **Current Status**: Planning workflow architecture
- **Attempted Solutions**: Researching modular workflow design patterns
- **Next Steps**: Create simple test workflows and evaluate their maintainability
- **Impact**: Could affect the long-term sustainability of the system

## Abandoned Approaches

### Single Table for All Workout Data
- **Approach**: Initially considered using a single table for all workout data
- **Reason for Abandonment**: Too inflexible for different workout types; couldn't efficiently handle varying numbers of sets
- **Date Abandoned**: 2025-04-19
- **Alternative Chosen**: Separate tables for strength exercises and cardio workouts
- **Lessons Learned**: Specialized data often requires specialized structures

## Anticipated Challenges

### GPT Context Management
- **Challenge**: Managing context effectively when using GPT for message processing
- **Potential Impact**: May affect the quality and relevance of agent responses
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Research context window optimization techniques; consider using embeddings for relevant context retrieval
- **Research Needed**: Best practices for context management with GPT models

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Challenge**: Coordinating activities and information sharing between different agents
- **Potential Impact**: Could lead to inconsistent user experience or information silos
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Design clear inter-agent communication protocols; implement central context repository
- **Research Needed**: Patterns for multi-agent systems in similar applications

### Data Privacy and Security
- **Challenge**: Ensuring sensitive financial and personal data is properly secured
- **Potential Impact**: Privacy concerns, potential regulatory issues
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement proper authentication, encryption, and access controls
- **Research Needed**: Best practices for securing personal data in Baserow and n8n

## Research Topics

### Islamic Finance Compliance
- **Topic**: Ensuring financial tracking and recommendations comply with Islamic finance principles
- **Importance**: Critical for zakat calculations and investment recommendations
- **Current Knowledge**: Basic understanding of zakat requirements
- **Research Questions**: 
  - What are the specific requirements for calculating zakat on different asset types?
  - How can we automate Shariah compliance checks for investments?

### Effective Quran Memorization Techniques
- **Topic**: Optimizing Abdullah's Quran memorization tracking for effective learning
- **Importance**: High for academic agent functionality
- **Current Knowledge**: Basic spaced repetition concepts
- **Research Questions**:
  - What memorization techniques are most effective for Quranic Arabic?
  - How can we optimize review schedules based on memorization strength?

## Decision Log

### Database Naming Convention
- **Decision**: Use agent number prefix for all tables (e.g., 0.Tasks for Alex)
- **Date**: 2025-04-19
- **Rationale**: Makes it easy to identify which agent each table belongs to
- **Alternatives Considered**: Functional prefixes, no prefixes
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Document Storage Approach
- **Decision**: Store document metadata in Baserow, actual files in Google Drive
- **Date**: 2025-04-19
- **Rationale**: Leverages Google Drive's robust file storage while maintaining structured metadata
- **Alternatives Considered**: Storing everything in Baserow, using a dedicated document management system
- **Decision Maker**: Development team
