# RexOS Development Challenges

This document tracks challenges encountered during the RexOS development process, including resolved issues, abandoned approaches, ongoing problems, and anticipated difficulties. It serves as both a knowledge base and a learning resource for the project.

## Resolved Challenges

### Document Content Extraction
- **Challenge**: Extracting meaningful content from documents sent via WhatsApp
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-05-01
- **Resolution Date**: 2023-05-01
- **Solution**: Implemented Mistral AI OCR integration with document information extraction
- **Root Cause**: Standard document handling only stored files without extracting their content
- **Lessons Learned**: Third-party OCR services provide powerful capabilities for document understanding

### Image Caption Classification
- **Challenge**: WhatsApp image captions were being classified as "unclassifiable" instead of being properly analyzed
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-29
- **Resolution Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Solution**: Modified the classification code to specifically check for and process image captions
- **Root Cause**: The code was checking messageType and immediately returning "unclassifiable" for non-text types
- **Lessons Learned**: Need to consider all message components (not just type) when designing classification logic

### Message Processing Complexity
- **Challenge**: Single processing path for all message types was becoming difficult to maintain and debug
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-30
- **Resolution Date**: 2023-04-30
- **Solution**: Split message processing into separate streams based on content type (text, image, audio, document)
- **Root Cause**: Different message types require specialized handling that was becoming unwieldy in a single flow
- **Lessons Learned**: Specialized processing streams improve maintainability and make troubleshooting easier

## Ongoing Challenges

### Media Processing Integration
- **Challenge**: Ensuring reliable media download and processing for various media types and sizes
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-30
- **Current Status**: Basic implementation complete, needs testing with various media types
- **Attempted Solutions**: Created separate processing streams for each media type
- **Next Steps**: Test with various media formats, sizes, and edge cases
- **Impact**: Affects the system's ability to process non-text content reliably

### Stream Merging
- **Challenge**: Merging processed content from different streams for consistent downstream processing
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-30
- **Current Status**: Design phase, implementation pending
- **Attempted Solutions**: Researching best approaches for stream merging
- **Next Steps**: Implement stream merging mechanism
- **Impact**: Affects the consistency of message processing after specialized handling

### Workflow Complexity Management
- **Challenge**: Keeping n8n workflows manageable and maintainable as complexity increases
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-29
- **Current Status**: Monitoring and looking for optimization opportunities
- **Attempted Solutions**: Looking for ways to simplify node structure
- **Next Steps**: Consider modular workflow design patterns
- **Impact**: Could affect long-term maintainability of the system

## Anticipated Challenges

### Supabase Integration
- **Challenge**: Properly integrating Supabase for data storage and retrieval
- **Potential Impact**: Could affect data persistence and retrieval functionality
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Research Supabase best practices and test thoroughly
- **Research Needed**: Supabase integration with n8n workflows

### Multi-language Support
- **Challenge**: Ensuring classification works correctly for both English and Arabic messages
- **Potential Impact**: May affect users who communicate in Arabic
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Test classification with various Arabic phrases and patterns
- **Research Needed**: Arabic language patterns for memory and task commands

## Decision Log

### Document OCR Integration
- **Decision**: Use Mistral AI for document OCR and content extraction
- **Date**: 2023-05-01
- **Rationale**: Provides high-quality OCR with structured data extraction capabilities
- **Alternatives Considered**: Google Cloud Vision OCR, Azure Document Intelligence, custom OCR solution
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Document Storage Approach
- **Decision**: Store documents in Google Drive with extracted metadata
- **Date**: 2023-05-01
- **Rationale**: Provides reliable storage with good integration capabilities and sharing options
- **Alternatives Considered**: Local storage, Supabase storage, other cloud storage providers
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Message Processing Architecture
- **Decision**: Split message processing into separate streams based on content type
- **Date**: 2023-04-30
- **Rationale**: Improves maintainability, makes troubleshooting easier, and allows for specialized processing
- **Alternatives Considered**: Enhanced single-stream processing, hybrid approach
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Media Processing Approach
- **Decision**: Use two-step process (URL retrieval followed by download) for all media types
- **Date**: 2023-04-30
- **Rationale**: Follows WhatsApp API requirements and provides consistent handling across media types
- **Alternatives Considered**: Direct media download, third-party media processing services
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Message Classification Approach
- **Decision**: Use pattern matching for initial classification, with potential for LLM enhancement later
- **Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Rationale**: Pattern matching is simpler and more efficient for basic classification needs
- **Alternatives Considered**: Using LLM for all classification, hybrid approach
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Image Caption Handling
- **Decision**: Process image captions the same way as text messages for classification
- **Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent user experience regardless of message type
- **Alternatives Considered**: Separate classification logic for different message types
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Development Tracking System
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive development tracking with timestamped entries
- **Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Rationale**: Ensures clear chronology and documentation of all development activities
- **Alternatives Considered**: Less structured documentation, using GitHub issues
- **Decision Maker**: Development team
