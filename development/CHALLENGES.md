# RexOS Development Challenges

This document tracks challenges encountered during the RexOS development process, including resolved issues, abandoned approaches, ongoing problems, and anticipated difficulties. It serves as both a knowledge base and a learning resource for the project.

## Resolved Challenges

### Image Caption Classification
- **Challenge**: WhatsApp image captions were being classified as "unclassifiable" instead of being properly analyzed
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-29
- **Resolution Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Solution**: Modified the classification code to specifically check for and process image captions
- **Root Cause**: The code was checking messageType and immediately returning "unclassifiable" for non-text types
- **Lessons Learned**: Need to consider all message components (not just type) when designing classification logic

## Ongoing Challenges

### WhatsApp Message Processing
- **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent message processing across different message types (text, image, voice)
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-29
- **Current Status**: Partially resolved for text and images with captions
- **Attempted Solutions**: Created specialized handling for image captions
- **Next Steps**: Test with more message types and edge cases
- **Impact**: Affects the reliability of the message classification system

### Workflow Complexity Management
- **Challenge**: Keeping n8n workflows manageable and maintainable as complexity increases
- **Date Encountered**: 2023-04-29
- **Current Status**: Monitoring and looking for optimization opportunities
- **Attempted Solutions**: Looking for ways to simplify node structure
- **Next Steps**: Consider modular workflow design patterns
- **Impact**: Could affect long-term maintainability of the system

## Anticipated Challenges

### Supabase Integration
- **Challenge**: Properly integrating Supabase for data storage and retrieval
- **Potential Impact**: Could affect data persistence and retrieval functionality
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Research Supabase best practices and test thoroughly
- **Research Needed**: Supabase integration with n8n workflows

### Multi-language Support
- **Challenge**: Ensuring classification works correctly for both English and Arabic messages
- **Potential Impact**: May affect users who communicate in Arabic
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Test classification with various Arabic phrases and patterns
- **Research Needed**: Arabic language patterns for memory and task commands

## Decision Log

### Message Classification Approach
- **Decision**: Use pattern matching for initial classification, with potential for LLM enhancement later
- **Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Rationale**: Pattern matching is simpler and more efficient for basic classification needs
- **Alternatives Considered**: Using LLM for all classification, hybrid approach
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Image Caption Handling
- **Decision**: Process image captions the same way as text messages for classification
- **Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent user experience regardless of message type
- **Alternatives Considered**: Separate classification logic for different message types
- **Decision Maker**: Development team

### Development Tracking System
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive development tracking with timestamped entries
- **Date**: 2023-04-29
- **Rationale**: Ensures clear chronology and documentation of all development activities
- **Alternatives Considered**: Less structured documentation, using GitHub issues
- **Decision Maker**: Development team
