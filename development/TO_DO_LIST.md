- [ ] Create dashboard for system monitoring

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Test and refine image caption handling**
   - Verify classification works correctly with image captions
   - Test with various types of captions
   - Ensure proper data flow through the workflow

2. **Implement memory storage in Supabase**
   - Create necessary tables in Supabase
   - Develop workflow for storing classified memories
   - Test storage and retrieval functionality

3. **Enhance error handling**
   - Add robust error handling to all nodes
   - Implement logging for debugging
   - Create recovery mechanisms for common failure points

## Notes and Considerations

- Prioritize fixing the image caption handling issue
- Focus on core functionality before adding new features
- Ensure all code is properly documented and stored according to guidelines
- Update the Done List after completing each action with precise timestamps

> **Note**: This To Do List is a living document and will be updated regularly as tasks are completed and new priorities emerge. Completed tasks will be moved to the [DONE_LIST.md](./DONE_LIST.md) file with appropriate timestamps.
