# RexOS Development To Do List

This file outlines the upcoming tasks and next steps for the RexOS development process. This list will be regularly updated as tasks are completed and new priorities emerge.

## High Priority Tasks

### WhatsApp Integration
- [x] Split message processing into separate streams for different message types
- [ ] Implement text message processing stream
- [ ] Implement image processing stream with vision model integration
- [ ] Implement audio transcription stream
- [ ] Test end-to-end message flow with all message types

### Memory Storage Implementation
- [ ] Create workflow for storing memories in Supabase
- [ ] Implement retrieval functionality for stored memories
- [ ] Add categorization for different types of memories

## Medium Priority Tasks

### Task Management System
- [ ] Create workflow for task creation and management
- [ ] Implement task status tracking
- [ ] Add task prioritization functionality

### Documentation Improvements
- [ ] Create detailed documentation for message classification system
- [ ] Document WhatsApp integration workflow
- [ ] Create user guide for memory storage functionality

### Code Optimization
- [ ] Review and optimize existing code
- [ ] Identify opportunities for workflow simplification
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Low Priority Tasks

### Additional Features
- [ ] Implement reminder functionality
- [ ] Add support for voice messages
- [ ] Create dashboard for system monitoring

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement text processing stream**
   - Create dedicated function node for text message processing
   - Ensure proper data flow and error handling
   - Test with various text message formats

2. **Implement image processing stream**
   - Complete media URL retrieval and download functionality
   - Integrate with vision model for image analysis
   - Implement caption extraction and interpretation
   - Test with various image types and captions

3. **Implement audio transcription stream**
   - Create dedicated function node for audio message processing
   - Implement media download for audio files
   - Integrate with transcription service
   - Test with various audio message types

4. **Implement memory storage in Supabase**
   - Create necessary tables in Supabase
   - Develop workflow for storing classified memories
   - Test storage and retrieval functionality

## Notes and Considerations

- Prioritize implementing the separate processing streams for better maintainability
- Focus on proper media handling for images and audio before adding advanced features
- Ensure robust error handling in each processing stream
- Test each stream independently before integrating them
- Update the Done List after completing each action with precise timestamps

> **Note**: This To Do List is a living document and will be updated regularly as tasks are completed and new priorities emerge. Completed tasks will be moved to the [DONE_LIST.md](./DONE_LIST.md) file with appropriate timestamps.
