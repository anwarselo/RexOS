## Next Immediate Steps for 2023-05-02

0. **Refine message filtering system**
   - Review current message filter implementation
   - Add safety checks for empty message arrays
   - Ensure proper handling of system messages
   - Test filter with various message types and edge cases

1. **Enhance document processing capabilities**
   - Implement document type detection for specialized handling
   - Add support for extracting structured data from common document formats
   - Create database schema for storing document metadata
   - Implement search functionality for document content
   - Test with various document formats (PDF, DOC, images of documents)

2. **Complete text processing stream**
   - Finalize text message classification logic
   - Implement action determination based on classification
   - Add error handling and logging
   - Test with various text message formats and languages

3. **Complete image processing stream**
   - Finalize vision model integration for image analysis
   - Implement caption and image content correlation
   - Add error handling for image processing failures
   - Test with various image types, sizes, and captions

4. **Complete audio transcription stream** ✓
   - ✓ Finalize transcription service integration
   - ✓ Implement post-transcription text processing with Voice Transcription Function node
   - ✓ Add error handling for audio processing failures
   - ✓ Test with various audio message types and languages

5. **Implement stream merging**
   - Create mechanism to merge processed messages from all streams
   - Ensure consistent data format for downstream processing
   - Implement priority handling for different message types
   - Test combined processing with mixed message types

6. **Begin memory storage implementation**
   - Create necessary tables in Supabase
   - Develop workflow for storing classified memories
   - Test storage and retrieval functionality

## Notes and Considerations

- Prioritize implementing the separate processing streams for better maintainability
- Focus on proper media handling for images and audio before adding advanced features
- Ensure robust error handling in each processing stream
- Test each stream independently before integrating them
- Update the Done List after completing each action with precise timestamps

> **Note**: This To Do List is a living document and will be updated regularly as tasks are completed and new priorities emerge. Completed tasks will be moved to the [DONE_LIST.md](./DONE_LIST.md) file with appropriate timestamps.
