### Modified Functionality

#### Message Processing Architecture
- **Previous Approach**: Used a single comprehensive message processor for all message types (text, image, audio)

  2. Visual Stream: Processes images through media download, vision model analysis, and caption interpretation
- **Motivation**: Improve troubleshooting capabilities and system maintainability
- **Impact**: Easier debugging, more specialized processing for each content type
- **Documentation Updates Needed**: WhatsApp integration documentation, system architecture documentation
