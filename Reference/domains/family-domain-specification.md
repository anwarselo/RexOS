## 9. Appendices

### 9.1 Example Interactions

**Example 1: Notification Management**

```
User: I'm getting too many notifications during meetings

Emma: I understand that notifications during meetings can be disruptive. I can help you manage this. Currently, you receive notifications for:

1. High priority tasks (immediate)
2. Email from VIP contacts (immediate)
3. Calendar reminders (15 min before events)
4. Team chat messages (immediate)

Would you like me to:
1. Create a "Meeting Mode" that silences all but critical notifications when your calendar shows you're in a meeting?
2. Customize which notification types can come through during meetings?
3. Batch non-urgent notifications to deliver after your meetings end?

User: Option 1 sounds good, but I still need to see messages from my boss

Emma: I've created a "Meeting Mode" that will automatically activate during scheduled meetings. During this mode:

- Only critical system alerts will notify immediately
- Messages from your boss (Sarah Johnson) will come through
- All other notifications will be batched and delivered after your meeting ends

I'll show you a summary of held notifications when each meeting ends. This will take effect starting with your next meeting at 2:00 PM today. Would you like to make any adjustments to this setup?
```

**Example 2: Communication Assistance**

```
User: I need to decline the project offer from ABC Corp but maintain the relationship

Emma: I can help you craft a diplomatic response. Here's a suggested message:

---
