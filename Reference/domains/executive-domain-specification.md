## 9. Appendices

### 9.1 Example Interactions

**Example 1: Task Creation**

```
User: I need to prepare the quarterly report by next Friday

Alex: I've created a task "Prepare quarterly report" with a deadline of next Friday at 5:00 PM. I've set this as a high priority task based on the deadline. Would you like to add any additional details or break this down into subtasks?

User: Yes, I'll need to gather data from the finance team first

Alex: I've added that detail and created a subtask "Gather data from finance team" that should be completed before the main task. When would you like to have this subtask completed?

User: By Wednesday

Alex: I've set the subtask deadline to Wednesday at 5:00 PM. I'll remind you about this on Wednesday morning. The task has been added to your focus list for this week.
```

**Example 2: Priority Management**

```
User: What should I focus on today?

Alex: Based on your current context and priorities, here are your top 3 focus tasks for today:

1. Prepare for tomorrow's client meeting (High priority, due today at 4:00 PM)
2. Review and sign contract (High priority, due tomorrow)
3. Complete expense report (Medium priority, due in 2 days)

You also have 2 quick tasks that could be completed if you have time:
- Call IT about laptop issue
- Schedule team lunch

Would you like to see more tasks or adjust these priorities?
```

### 9.2 Troubleshooting

**Common Issue 1: Task Overload**

*Symptoms:* Too many high-priority tasks, user feeling overwhelmed

*Solution:*
1. Implement temporary priority ceiling
2. Suggest task delegation where appropriate
3. Recommend time-blocking for focused work
4. Help renegotiate deadlines where possible
5. Break down large tasks into smaller steps

**Common Issue 2: Priority Misalignment**

*Symptoms:* User frequently overrides suggested priorities

*Solution:*
1. Analyze patterns in user adjustments
2. Update priority calculation weights
3. Request explicit priority guidance
4. Provide explanation for priority recommendations
5. Adjust to user's implicit prioritization style
