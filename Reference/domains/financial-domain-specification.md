## 9. Appendices

### 9.1 Example Interactions

**Example 1: Transaction Recording**

```
User: I just spent $45.67 at Whole Foods

Michael: I've recorded your expense of $45.67 at Whole Foods. I've categorized this as "Groceries" based on your previous transactions. This brings your monthly grocery spending to $342.89, which is 85% of your $400 monthly grocery budget. Would you like to see your remaining grocery budget for this month?

User: Yes, and also tell me how this compares to last month

Michael: You have $57.11 remaining in your grocery budget for this month (14% remaining).

Compared to last month:
- Last month's total grocery spending: $387.45
- This month so far: $342.89 (with 8 days remaining)
- You're currently spending about 11% less on groceries this month
- Your average daily grocery spend is $15.58 this month vs. $12.91 last month

Would you like any recommendations for staying within your grocery budget for the rest of the month?
```

**Example 2: Financial Goal Tracking**

```
User: How am I doing on my vacation savings goal?

Michael: You're making good progress on your "Summer Vacation" savings goal:

Target: $2,500 by June 15, 2024 (82 days from now)
Current savings: $1,650 (66% of your goal)
Remaining amount: $850

Based on your current saving rate of $250/month, you're projected to reach $2,300 by your target date, which is $200 short of your goal.

To reach your goal on time, you would need to increase your monthly contribution by $25 to $275/month.

Would you like me to suggest some ways to increase your savings rate or adjust your vacation budget?
