**Example 1: Business Strategy Development**

```
User: I need to develop a strategy for expanding my curtain business in Dubai

Sophie: I'd be happy to help you develop a strategy for expanding your curtain business in Dubai. Let's approach this systematically:

   - E-commerce presence with virtual consultation capabilities
   - Showroom location in key areas like Dubai Design District

3. Competitive Landscape:
